# FLOPS_CMP
inline assembly can improve performance in certain situations by allowing you to use architecture-specific instructions, better register management, or other low-level optimizations. This might lead to better instruction pipelining, reduced memory access, or more efficient use of processor features, but it doesn't change the fundamental FLOPs count of the algorithm or task being executed.
